# Fresh-tomatoes-movie-website
Movie website

This is a website that contains 6 of my favorite movies.

If you click on a movie, the theatrical trailer will play in a small window on the webpage.

To run this webpage, download the zip file, unpack it, and open the HTML file "fresh_tomatoes.html."

The file "media.py" creates the class Movie. The file "entertainment_center.py" 
runs the instance of movie, and the file "fresh_tomatoes.py" contains the source code for running the page.
